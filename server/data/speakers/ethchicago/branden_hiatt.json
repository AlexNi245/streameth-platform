{"id":"branden_hiatt","name":"Branden Hiatt","bio":"Branden is the owner of Sheepdog Enterprises LLC. Branden started out as an owner-operator running under his own authority in 2020. After seeing the struggles hotshot owner-operators dealt with firsthand, he wanted to build a business model that assisted other owner-operators getting started and set them up for success. In 2022 Sheepdog Enterprises leased on their first owner-operator and has since grown to 6 owner-operators. Sheepdog Enterprises has since added a dispatch only division and works with new owner-operators and carriers to help them get started.","eventId":"ethchicago","photo":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/095B9753-4482-4457-BAC1-1E019B45913B_QgurMLa.jpeg"}
