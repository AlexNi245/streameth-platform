{"id":"kinchasaeth","name":"Kinchasa.eth","bio":"Kin is the founder of Idiotb0x, a fledgling startup working at the intersection of AI and web3 and was a founding member of the Defiant Pixel Society. \r\n\r\nKin has been pulling at the thread of web3 since 2018 trying to take in the full potential of blockchain as a new medium akin to digital marble. He spent much of that time in the NFT scene as an ENS maxi and fairy, with a collection of on-chain pixel art only rivaled by Moderats. He is a poet of sorts having founded Cipher - a collectible hip hop platform, a pixel artist and occasional raider in the Raid Guild.","eventId":"ethchicago","photo":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/H6jivT1P_400x400_SRrg9ev.jpg"}
