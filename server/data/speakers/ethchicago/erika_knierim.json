{"id":"erika_knierim","name":"Erika Knierim","bio":"Erika is an attorney, legal engineer and finance professional with 14+ years of experience working with organizations ranging from international investment banks to multi-billion dollar technology startups. \r\n\r\nShe is an advocate for her clientâ€™s goal of maximizing value whether in the courtroom or an investment portfolio. This desire led to acquiring deep knowledge of how tokenization and blockchain technologies are affecting finance and the law. Beginning with crypto-finance, she has become an expert in topics ranging from tokenization and supply chains to NFTs and smart contracts and how they affect a company's profitability and growth. \r\n\r\nOver the past two years, she has worked on the frontline of blockchain regulatory law and become intimately knowledgeable on the changing global regulatory landscape for cryptocurrency, working directly with several regulatory governing bodies and leading legal blockchain authorities. Through extensive access to leading industry players, she came to believe in the need for greater adoption of emerging blockchain solutions by legacy institutions and the need for strong regulatory solutions that protect consumers but still encourage innovation. \r\n\r\nIn addition to her work with Nomic, Erika also serves as an Executive Team Lead for the Tokenized Commodities Council where she is spearheading the creation of a digital commodities taxonomy and as a Mentor for the WAC (Web3 Arts & Culture) Fellowship, where she helps arts institutions navigate the blockchain ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHer work is driven by a desire to create agency in a technological world, support physical engagement, ensure safety and security, expand a sense of ownership in the world we inhabit, and facilitate the preservation of assets and memories.","eventId":"ethchicago","photo":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/EK-White_oqkJlD5.png"}
