I am a father, husband, and a son. Family and friends are very important to me. I have lived my life with the goal of making every year worthy of a good movie or a great book. I take risks, embrace adventure and live life to the fullest. And as a result, I have many wonderful stories. I minted my first NFT 2013 before NFT were even a thing I am always way to early. I love working with good people I have become pat of the ImnotArt team this year and working on a new project SUP!? With my good friend Eric Bobby. I run Childhood Fractured this is a non-profit humanities-based human rights initiative centered on preventing the sexual abuse and exploitation of children.","eventId":"ethchicago","photo":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/822BB6FD-5C09-49E9-BFDB-4229F9AE01F1_2p9V1jg.jpeg"}
