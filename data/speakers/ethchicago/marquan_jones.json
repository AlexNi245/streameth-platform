{"id":"marquan_jones","name":"Marquan Jones","bio":"My name is Marquan Jones, I am a brand strategist and technology innovation consultant, as well as the president of the Chicago Fashion Coalition. With my background in sociology and community development, I bring a unique perspective on the intersection of fashion and technology.\r\n\r\nMy work focuses on the transformative potential of emerging technologies in various industries. I strive to leverage technology to create positive change and empower individuals and communities within the fashion space.\r\n\r\nAs someone deeply interested in technology and its potential impact, I naturally gravitated toward exploring the emerging trends in the digital space. NFTs and Web3 caught my attention because they represent a paradigm shift in the way we think about ownership, creativity, and value exchange. The idea of digital assets and decentralized systems fascinated me. I saw an opportunity to explore how these concepts could reshape the fashion industry and open up new possibilities for designers, creators, and consumers.","eventId":"ethchicago","photo":"https://pretalx.com/media/avatars/IMG_7764_Jsvce2Q.JPG"}
