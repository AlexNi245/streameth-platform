{"id":"albert_rubio","name":"Albert Rubio","bio":"Over the last four years I have been leading the development of the circom compiler. Circom is one of the leading languages for defining ZK protocols and its open source compiler is fully written in Rust. Additionally, I have also extensively worked on developing tools and techniques for the security, safety and gas consumption analysis of smart contracts and on EVM bytecode optimization and I am currently working on verifying safety and security properties of circom programs.","eventId":"progcrypto","twitter":"","photo":"https://airtable.com/app97bmhTTBXgYaAm/tblSQwuXzMHHYJPLn/viwFfYvZqDw5ZzXfv/recJwzFtHj9di9wF9/fldAeQTdo6JTzTYW1/attFdO5vdfyNIbVr7?blocks=hide"}
