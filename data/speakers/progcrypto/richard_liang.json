{"id":"richard_liang","name":"Richard Liang","bio":"I am currently a PSE grantee as part of the ZKP2P project. We are building the first trustless P2P onramp powered by ZK proofs in close collaboration with the zkemail team. We want to time our deployment of this protocol to production at this event!\n\nI am one of the founders of Set Protocol, where we built a DeFi index protocol and launched some popular financial products that reached >$500M in assets. Additionally, I built / contributed to a few open source ZK libraries: RSA in Noir, SHA1 in halo2 KZG, Black Scholes options pricing in halo2, and verifying a chain of certificates in halo2 KZG.\n\nI mostly have experience building fullstack apps / smart contract protocols, which require connecting all parts of the stack and delivering an end product to the user. ZK is the newest part of the app stack, and I'm excited to get innovative ZK powered apps into the hands of users (e.g. ZKP2P when we launch)","eventId":"progcrypto","twitter":"","photo":"https://airtable.com/app97bmhTTBXgYaAm/tblSQwuXzMHHYJPLn/viwFfYvZqDw5ZzXfv/recgrVVI05Toob1gM/fldAeQTdo6JTzTYW1/attl8QJ3BPkDDXXLG?blocks=hide"}
