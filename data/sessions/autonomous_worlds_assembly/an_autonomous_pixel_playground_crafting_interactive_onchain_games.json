{"id":"an_autonomous_pixel_playground_crafting_interactive_onchain_games","name":"An Autonomous Pixel Playground: Crafting Interactive Onchain Games.","description":"In this workshop, we'll cover the process of permissionlessly creating pixel-based onchain games, using PixeLAW as our case study.\n\nThe main goal will be to showcase the different stages of how interactive and interoperable games can be designed and built. Namely,\n1. Initiation and building process.\n2. How they evolve through cooperation of different game creators and players.\n3. Emergence of new, unexpected gaming experiences.\n\nWe do not expect participants to code along, but to spark a meaningful discussion around the practicalities of developing diverse onchain games within a single, autonomous ecosystem.\n\nWe believe that until now, conversations on this topic have often been theoretical; our workshop aims to shift that narrative by discussing practical implementations.\n\nThe session is open to any developer,  gamer, or enthusiasts simply intrigued by the future of onchain gaming.","start":1700118000000,"end":1700121600000,"stageId":"beylerbeyi_1","speakers":[{"id":"jk","name":"JK","bio":"John is a product-centered entrpreneur with 5 years of experience in crafting consumer software products in Europe and Asia.
