{"id":"interactive_fog_of_war_for_network_states","name":"Interactive Fog of War for Network States","description":"Fog of war for Network States required this core interaction type: player A needed to modify player B's shielded state. We found that solutions based on pure zero knowledge / fully homomorphic encryption / multi-party computation were insufficient for the experience that we wanted to deliver to gamers. This includes asynchronous gameplay, sub-quadratic communication complexity, and minimal hardware requirements. To provide this experience, we settled on a solution with hardware-based trust assumptions on shielding and pure cryptographic / proof-of-stake based assumptions for existing AW properties such as infiniteness, provenance, and composability. We're excited to share learnings. We hope that many of them can generalize to other teams who want to build interactive fog of war.","start":1700046900000,"end":1700047800000,"stageId":"emirgan_2","speakers":[{"id":"lyron_co_ting_keh","name":"Lyron Co Ting Keh","bio":"My areas of interest include recursion [eg.
