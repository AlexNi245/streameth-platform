We'll be focusing on this through the lens of live game design and technical decision making, as we saw interesting social dynamics (faction switching, manipulation / trickery, player recruitment and other shenanigans) and technical dynamics (botting and community created clients, item burning) play out in real time. We think this talk will be interesting to onchain game developers interested in running their own socially engaging onchain game competitions.","start":1700052300000,"end":1700053200000,"stageId":"emirgan_1","speakers":[{"id":"matt_van","name":"Matt Van","bio":"At Proof of Play, Matt leads teams of engineers building our first fully onchain game, Pirate Nation, as well as our infrastructure, the { to be announced } engine.
