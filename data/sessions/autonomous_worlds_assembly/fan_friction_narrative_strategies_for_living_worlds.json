{"id":"fan_friction_narrative_strategies_for_living_worlds","name":"Fan Friction: Narrative Strategies for Living Worlds","description":"It's common to approach worldbuilding from extremes: either as prescriptive, top-down design of a detailed environment, or as a blank canvas for collaborative creativity. The first perspective undervalues participant input, leading to detailed yet scarcely populated worlds. The second prioritizes participant agency, but risks developing chaotic and incoherent environments. This session aims to steer clear of these extremes, focusing instead on the roles participants play in expanding existing worlds and strategies for inhabiting shared narratives.","start":1700123400000,"end":1700125200000,"stageId":"emirgan_1","speakers":[{"id":"kara_kittel","name":"Kara Kittel","bio":"Kara Kittel is a creative producer and researcher based in New York.
