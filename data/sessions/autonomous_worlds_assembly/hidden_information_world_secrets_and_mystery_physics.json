{"id":"hidden_information_world_secrets_and_mystery_physics","name":"Hidden information, world secrets and mystery physics","description":"From private inventories, to confidential treaties and fog-of-war, secrets are central to a game designer's toolkit. However, blockchains are inherently public structures. In this interactive session we'll walk you through the art of the possible when it comes to embedding your world with secrets and mysteries, bringing you up to speed with the latest cryptographic innovations and hacky workarounds. Bring your gnarliest ideas and we'll figure out how to make it work onchain! This session will be suitable for nontechnical folk - but we may take a few minutes here and there to take a (signposted!) deep dive into some code.","start":1700042400000,"end":1700046000000,"stageId":"beylerbeyi_1","speakers":[{"id":"tonk_baz__goblin_oats","name":"Tonk (Baz & Goblin Oats)","bio":"Exasperated at the state of the world and the web, we founded Tonk to help liberate the open internet beyond just finance. To that end, we work with onchain game studios to bake hidden information into their worlds. We also authored the Privacy Playgrounds Wiki and started Dappicom, a zkNES emulator in Noir. Our work sits in the sweet spot between applied cryptography, gaming and the philosophy of privacy-enabled coordination.","eventId":"autonomous_worlds_assembly","twitter":"@tonk_gg","photo":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1nWydNN61Tr6DfR8cAEj_DE_bkFfE6bO9"}],"playbackId":"","eventId":"autonomous_worlds_assembly","coverImage":"/sessions/autonomous_worlds_assembly/hidden_information_world_secrets_and_mystery_physics.jpg"}
