  "description": "We will discuss cryptographic resilience within Ethereum.  We intend to discuss the attack vectors for existing and potential future protocols on Layer 1.  Relevant topics include but are not limited to state-of-the-art attacks against widely used cryptographic assumptions, the quantum threat and what could we do to future-proof ourselves, past attacks and their impact, and how we model should security of real world protocols.  We will invite leading researchers and implementers with a good track record of delivering interesting talks.\n\n### [WEB](https://sites.google.com/cryptographicresilience/home)",
